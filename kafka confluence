Confluence Page: Creating Kafka Topics Securely Using Python
Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to creating a Kafka topic securely using Python. We’ll leverage Kafka's security features, such as SSL/TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms, to ensure that the topic creation process is safe and restricted to authorized users.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Kafka Server with SSL/TLS configured.
Python 3.7+ installed on your machine.
Kafka Admin client library for Python, e.g., confluent_kafka.
SSL/TLS certificates and access credentials, including:
Binary file with the encrypted binary key and certificates.
Password file for decrypting the certificates.
2. Setting Up the Environment
2.1. Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries with pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install confluent_kafka
2.2. Load the SSL/TLS Certificate and Password
Place the binary and password files in a secure location and load them into your script as needed for authentication.

3. Secure Kafka Configuration
To interact with a secure Kafka instance, we’ll use SSL/TLS configurations. Here's a sample configuration:
